  <p>WHAT EXACTLY IS A ROOT CANAL?<br />
    A root canal is a dental procedure that is used to remove diseased pulp tissue from the
    interior of a tooth. The narrow channels beneath the pulp chamber in the inner part of
    the tooth are hollowed out and cleaned, and the roots are filed with flexible nickel
    titanium files.</p>
  <p>A tooth is made up of three main components: a hard protective shell referred to as
    enamel, a softer and sensitive middle layer referred to as dentin and a soft tissue inner
    layer referred to as dental pulp. Dental pulp is composed of nerve tissue, lymph tissue
    and blood vessels, and is considered to be the vital part of a tooth.</p>
  <p>If dental pulp is sufficiently traumatized - whether by exposure to oral bacteria via deep
    dental caries, a fracture in the tooth that enters the pulp or a forceful blow to the face -
    the tooth begins to die and root canal therapy is often required in order to prevent or
    eliminate infection and prevent tooth loss.</p>

  <p>ROOT CANAL PROCEDURES<br />
    A root canal procedure involves tooth disinfection and the removal of all debris (nerve
    tissue, lymph tissue, blood tissue, bacteria and infection) from the coronal pulp chamber
    and its associated canals. Once an affected tooth's canals are sufficiently cleansed and
    shaped, they are filled with filling materials designed to prevent pain and infection from
    recurring.</p>
  <p>ROOT CANAL SIGNS<br />
    Certain signs may indicate that you have a diseased tooth or infected nerve and
    therefore may need a root canal. These signs include: Minimal to severe pain; Tooth
    discoloration; Swelling and irritation in the surrounding gum tissue; Signs of infection
    visible on a radiograph. A root canal is typically recommended in such situations to save
    the affected tooth and preserve its functionality.</p>
  <p>WHY ARE THE ASSOCIATED TOOTHACHES SO PAINFUL?<br />
    Nerve fibers, blood, and lymph tissues are housed in the root canals. Located inside
    each tooth is a pulp chamber that funnels into those root canals. A tooth can become
    inflamed or infected for several reasons, including severe tooth decay or a crack or chip in the tooth.</p>
  <p>Failing restorations such as dental fillings and dental crowns can foster bacterial leakage
    into the dental pulp. Once infected, the dental pulp begins to die and the body's
    inflammatory responses set in. The combination of infection and inflammation can cause
    significant pain. The end result is a toothache.</p>
  <p>In cases where tooth extraction is the only solution, the missing tooth may be replaced
    with a dental implant or dental bridge to maintain functionality. By replacing the missing
    tooth, a proper bite is maintained and the surrounding teeth are prevented from shifting.
    Because a severe infection can be very dangerous, it is important to receive a
    professional evaluation. If an infection spreads beyond the jaw to the head and neck.
    then more extensive medical treatment, including hospitalization, may be required.</p>
