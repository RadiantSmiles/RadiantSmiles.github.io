    <p>The term &quot;bonding&quot; is used in dentistry to describe permanently attaching 
      dental materials to your teeth using dental adhesives and a high intensity 
      curing light. Tooth-colored composites (white or natural-looking filling 
      materials) are used to fill cavities, repair chips or cracks, or close gaps 
    between your teeth. The material can be placed where needed.</p>
    <p>Because composite bonding involves the precise placement of filling 
      material, the bonding procedure usually is completed in one dental visit. 
      More complicated or extensive treatments may require additional visits.</p>
    <p>The same composite materials also may be directly applied and sculpted 
      to the surfaces of teeth that show most prominently when you smile, for 
      minimally invasive smile makeovers. While technically being called &quot;direct 
      composite veneers,&quot; many people just refer to them generically as 
      &quot;bonding.&quot; Composite bonding usually is an ideal and less expensive 
      solution for people with chips, gaps between the teeth, or misshapen teeth.</p>
