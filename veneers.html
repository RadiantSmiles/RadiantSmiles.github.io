  <p>Dental veneers are custom-designed shells of tooth-like ceramic material that, when 
    applied over the surface of a tooth, can cover worn tooth enamel, uneven tooth 
    alignment or spacing and chips or cracks.</p>
  <p> With veneers we can create a bright, white smile with beautifully aligned, naturally- 
    shaped teeth. Even better, the translucent ceramic quality of today's veneers provides a 
    more natural look than what's been available in the past.</p>
  <p> Regardless of what causes unattractive teeth, dental veneers may solve most or even all 
    of your cosmetic dental issues. including:</p>

    substance covering your teeth (enamel) may become 
    worn, dulled, and discolored. Such wear and 
    discoloration may be natural or the result of a 
    genetic predisposition; however, it is often a result of 
    your habits (soft drink, tea, or coffee consumption, 
    smoking, medication use, etc.}.</p>
  <p> 2. Genetics: Certain people may be born with 
    abnormal spacing between their teeth, or have teeth 
    that are misshapen but otherwise healthy.</p>
  <p> 3. Uneven teeth: Uneven teeth can result from tooth 
    grinding or general wear and tear.</p>

  <p> WHEN ARE VENEERS APPROPRlATE7<br />
    Bonding often serves as an inexpensive and effective restoration for small chips and 
    cracks in the teeth. Such minor problems may be functionally and cosmetically 
    repaired with a composite &quot;white filling.&quot; A composite resin material is bonded to the 
    tooth in order to fill in the chip or crack and better protect the surrounding tooth 
    structure. But for more severe cases of dullness, wear, discoloration, mild chipping, 
    cracking, spacing, or uneven/misshapen teeth, veneers may be recommended as a more 
    appropriate solution.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> VENEERS OR WHITENING?<br />
    Teeth whitening may provide a white smile for mildly discolored teeth. Some people who 
    are interested in veneers will find that the simpler alternative of whitening, perhaps 
    combined with some simple orthodontic alignment, will satisfy their desire for an 
    improvement in their smile. The placement of veneers requires the &quot;shaping&quot; or 
    &quot;prepping&quot; of all teeth being fitted with the custom-designed shells. This process 
    permanently alters the teeth that are treated and therefore must be seriously taken into 
    consideration.</p>
  <p> <img src="images/veneers2.jpg" width="228" height="127" align="right" style="padding-left: 10px" />If you have a severe case of misshapen, 
    dull or discolored teeth, you may have to 
    opt for dental veneers. Veneers do have 
    the added benefits of longevity and a 
    proven ability to enhance the appearance 
    of the mouth, smile, and possibly other 
    areas of an aged face that would be better 
    supported by properly shaped teeth. 
    Although veneers require a much larger 
    commitment than teeth whitening, the 
    results are typically well worth it.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p> A RESTORATIVE BENEFIT TO VENEERS<br />
    In addition to being esthetically pleasing, dental veneers can also serve a functional 
    purpose by protecting the surface of a damaged tooth. ln some cases, veneers may 
    replace the need for a dental crown, eliminating the need for more invasive tooth 
    preparation. In some cases, because dental veneers are so thin, they might require little- 
    to-no tooth reshaping when bonded onto the tooth. Once veneers are bonded into place, 
    they are relatively strong and durable; however, care must be taken so as not to abuse 
    veneers because the thin porcelain shells can damage or break. We may recommend 
    you wear a protective appliance while your sleep. especially if you are a bruxer.</p>
