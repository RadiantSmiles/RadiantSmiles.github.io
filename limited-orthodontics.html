    <p><img src="images/invisalign.jpg" width="277" height="200" align="left" style="padding-right: 10px;" />Invisalign takes a modern approach to straightening teeth, using a custom-made series of aligners created for you and only you.  These algner trays are made of smooth, comfortable, and virtually invisible plastic that you simply wear over your teeth.  Wearing the aligner will gradually and gently shift your teeth into place, based on the exact movements your dentist plans out for you.  There are no metal brackets to attach and no wires to tighten.  You simply pop in a new set of aligners approximately every two weeks, until your treatment is complete and you achieve the confident smile that you've always wanted.  The best part about the whole process is that most people won't even know you're straightening your teeth.</p>
