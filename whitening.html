    <p>Whitening of the teeth is performed for patients who desire a brighter
      smile. Tooth whitening can be performed to reduce discoloration and
      staining, or simply to provide the patient with whiter, brighter teeth.    </p>
    <p>Teeth enamel discoloration can be caused by staining, aging, or chemical
      damage to teeth. Some of the more common causes of teeth discoloration
      are medications, coffee, tea or cigarettes. People who drink significant
      amounts of cola soft drinks can experience similar staining.      </p>
    <p>Teeth whitening is not a permanent procedure. Results can last for one to
      or more years, depending upon your personal habits. ln most cases, the
      whitening procedure is very effective and our patients are pleased with the
      results.</p>
