    Dental crowns, also known as &quot;caps,&quot; preserve the 
    functionality of damaged teeth. Crowns may be used to 
    protect a cracked tooth, restore functionality of a tooth with 
    excessive decay or a large existing filling, or replace a 
    pre-existing crown. The purpose of a dental crown is to 
    encase a needy tooth with a custom-designed material.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>BRIDGE<br />
    Fixed partial dentures (aka dental bridges) are an 
    extension of the dental crown treatment for replacement of 
    missing teeth. Crowns are placed on the teeth adjacent to 
    the missing tooth or teeth and connected to a missing 
    tooth-like replica. Although bridges may serve as a 
    functional and esthetic restoration, today's treatment-of- 
    choice for a missing tooth or teeth is with dental implants. 
    A dental implant replaces missing teeth with a titanium root 
    replica. A crown is then placed on the implant above the 
    gumline. Dental implants are a very predictable treatment 
    choice, returning support to the bite and preventing the 
    need for the unnecessary crowning of adjacent teeth.</p>

  <p>CROWN MATERIALS<br />
    The three predominant choices of restorative materials for the full coverage crowns are:</p>
  <p>1. Porcelain-fused-to-metal<br />
    2. All-ceramic (all-porcelain)<br />
    3. Gold</p>
  <p>The material selected is determined by the clinical demands at hand, esthetic demands, 
    strength requirements, material durability and restorative space available.</p>
  <p>PORCELAIN-FUSED-TO-METAL CROWNS<br />
    Porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns provide for a strong, durable. and esthetic treatment 
    option. One of the key factors for the esthetic and functional success of this type of 
    crown is ensuring the preparation of the underlying tooth structure provides adequate 
    space for the appropriate thickness of the material selected. Additionally, the artistic skill 
    of the laboratory technologist creating the crown will determine its esthetic appeal. One 
    consideration in the porcelain-fused-to-metal crown is that these crowns may tend to 
    show the underlying metal or gold margin at the gum line as gums recede over time.</p>

    The predominant material choice for all-ceramic crowns 
    today is either zirconia, or aluminous materials. They 
    provide a metal-free esthetic option with a number of 
    benefits.</p>
  <p>By eliminating the need for the supportive metal core, an 
    esthetic all-ceramic crown can be created with a reduced 
    thickness of material. This makes them a more favorable 
    treatment choice in areas with limited space. Additionally, 
    the elimination of the metal core allows for light 
    transmission through the porcelain for better optical, life- 
    like properties and a higher level of esthetics.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>GOLD CROWNS<br />
    Although not as popular a treatment choice tor esthetic reasons, gold crowns are still 
    indicated in some instances. For example, patients with strong bites and those with 
    parafunctional habits (such as grinding or clenching) might be better served with a gold 
    crown. The traditional restorative material can provide stronger support to the remaining 
    healthy tooth structure. Gold crowns offer a level of durability that is appropriate tor teeth.</p>
