  <p>Periodontology, or Periodontics, is the branch of dentistry which studies
    supporting structures of teeth, and diseases and conditions that affect
    them.</p>
  <p>The supporting tissues are known as the periodontium, which includes the
    gingiva (gums), alveolar bone, cementum, and the periodontal ligament.
    The word comes from the Greek words peri meaning around and odons
    meaning tooth. Literally taken, it means study of that which is &quot;around the
    tooth&quot;.</p>
  <p>Periodontal diseases take on many different forms but are usually a result
    of a coalescence of bacterial plaque biofilm accumulation of the gingiva
    and teeth, combined with host immuno-inflammatory mechanisms and
    other risk factors which lead to destruction of the supporting bone around
    natural teeth. Untreated, these diseases lead to alveolar bone loss and
    tooth loss and, to date, continue to be the leading cause of tooth loss in
    adults.</p>
